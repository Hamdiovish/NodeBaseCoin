<h2>What is Nodebase?</h2>
<p>
NodeBase (NDB) is a masternode coin and platform that addresses the current challenges in the
market by providing a unique combination of masternode related services. The masternode market
has seen tremendous growth over the last years which has created a wealth of opportunities but also
a wide arrange of challenges that limit further adoption: Investors are required to have a high degree
of technical knowledge and large amounts of capital on hand. The masternode market is inaccessible
and thus fundamentally prone to fraud. Additionally, masternode investments come with a range of
complex investment decisions that need to be made in a dynamically changing market environment.
NodeBase proposes solutions to these challenges by offering high-quality and easy-to-use
masternode hosting and management, laddered masternodes as well as shared masternode hosting, a
masternode marketplace with built-in escrow service, and automated profit conversion. We believe
these solutions will eliminate roadblocks for adoption and allow the masternode ecosystem to expand
further.
